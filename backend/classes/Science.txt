BIO 200LLB - Evolutionary Biology
This course is designed as a general introduction to organismal biology: what happens at the level of the organism and above. Students will learn how evolution works, what organisms evolution has created, and how those organisms interact with the environment and each other. These three topics comprise the three sections of the course material: evolution, diversity, and ecology. Students will gain a general facility with the major topics of each of these fields to prepare them for future courses in the biology department and related fields. This course is a controlled enrollment (impacted) course. Students who have previously attempted the course and received a grade other than W may repeat the course in the summer or winter; or only in the fall or spring semester with a petition to the College of Arts and Sciences Deans’ Office.

GLY 101LEC - Natural Hazards
This Scientific Literacy and Inquiry course explores the solid Earth and ways that ongoing, natural processes act to harm people and property. The course aims to put geological hazards in a broader context by examining the latest science at the micro (e.g., minerals), human (e.g., why tsunamis are such efficient and massive killers) and global (e.g., global effects of asteroid impacts or super volcano eruptions) scales. We will examine the history of scientific discovery and thought about natural hazards and global catastrophes on both human and geologic timescales. We will use case studies and debates to clarify science vs. pseudo-science, current controversies, and how natural (as well as some human-induced) hazards affect us in Western New York. Completing all three courses, GLY 101LEC, GLY 102 and GLY 105, would fulfill the Scientific Inquiry and Literacy Requirement as well as the Natural Sciences General Education requirement.

GLY 104LAB - Earth History & Fossils Lab
Historical Geology provides the student with a comprehensive survey of the history of life and major events in the physical development of Earth. Most importantly, this class addresses how processes like plate tectonics and climate interact with life, forming an integrated system. The first half of the class focuses on theoretical concepts within both the biosphere and lithosphere (e.g., tectonics, earth sciences, evolution) and the second portion of the course will focus on a chronologic overview of major biological and physical events in different geologic periods. This lab course aims to enhance student Earth science college-level content knowledge, awareness, and analysis and critical thinking skills in a broad context by examining the temporal, regional and global (e.g., climate and ecological change through time) scales. This course is designed to develop skills in map-reading, cladistics/systematics, problem-solving, and to foster learning of the interactions between Earth processes, the environment, and the biosphere. We will apply the scientific method and foster student analysis of scientific data and models to evaluate leading concepts in both geological and paleontological science.

It is designed to develop skills in map-reading, problem-solving, and to foster hands-on learning of the interactions between Earth processes, the environment, and humans. We will apply the scientific method and foster student analysis of scientific data and models to evaluate leading concepts in Earth science. Finally, through case studies and debates, it will discuss science vs. pseudo-science, current controversies, and how earth science affects our everyday lives.

PHY 117LR - Honors Physics I
PHY 117 is a calculus based Honors physics course, which covers similar topics as PHY 107, but in greater depth. This course is intended for potential physics majors, students in the honors college, and advanced students in other majors (with permission from the instructor). The class will be taught at a level comfortable for students who would receive a B or higher in a typical PHY 107 class. Because of the higher average GPA of students in this class, grading will be adjusted to reflect this quality, rather than following the conventional curves used for PHY 107. Introductory materials, such as review of trigonometry, vectors and calculus, in PHY 107 will not be covered. This leaves room to expose students to a wider range of interesting applications of Newtonian mechanics, and recent developments in topics such as Special Relativity and Cosmology. The class size is limited, to encourage interactive learning and communications between students and the instructor. This course satisfies 4 credits (out of the mandated 7 credits total) of UB’s Science Literacy and Inquiry General Education requirements.
