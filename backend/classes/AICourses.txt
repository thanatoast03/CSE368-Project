CSE 368LR - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence appears in many practical situations: from problems such as returning relevant text to a vague question to robotic cars that need to safely navigate chaotic traffic. As a result, AI is frequently in the news for both important ethical questions and practical breakthroughs. This course is an introduction to AI for upper division students. The goal is to put these topics into a common perspective and to give you practical hands-on skill in solving AI problems through programming assignments.

CSE 440LEC - Machine Learning and Society for Majors
Machine Learning (ML) systems make decisions in all parts of our lives, starting from the mundane (e.g. Netflix recommending us movies/TV shows), to the somewhat more relevant (e.g. algorithms deciding which ads Google shows you) to the downright worrisome (e.g. algorithms deciding the risk of a person who is arrested committing a crime in the future). Whether we like it or not, ML systems are here to stay: the economic benefit of automation provided by ML systems means companies and even governments will continue to use algorithms to make decisions that shape our lives. While the benefits of using algorithms to make such decisions can be obvious, these algorithms sometimes have unintended/unforeseen harmful effects. This class will look into various ML systems in use in real life and go into depth of both the societal as well as technical issues. For students who are more technologically inclined, this course will open their eyes to societal implications of technology that such students might create in the future (and at the very least see why claiming ?But algorithms/math cannot be biased? is at best a cop-out). For students who are more interested in the societal implications of algorithms, this class will give them a better understanding of the technical/mathematical underpinnings of these algorithms (because if you do not understand, at some non-trivial level, how these algorithms work you cannot accurately judge the societal impacts of an algorithm). Students cannot take both CSE 440 (this course) and CSE 441 Machine Learning and Society for Non-Majors.

Typically Offered: Spring
Requisites: Pre-Requisite: (CSE 474 or CSE 368) or (CSE 331 and (CSE 474 or CSE 368) as a co-requisite); Co-Requisite: (CSE 474 or CSE 368) (if CSE 331 already completed); Students cannot take both CSE 440 and CSE 441.

CSE 446LEC - Reinforcement Learning
This course is intended for students interested in artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning where an agent learns how to behave in an environment by performing actions and assessing the results. Reinforcement learning is how Google DeepMind created the AlphaGo system that beat a high-ranking Go player and how AlphaStar become the first artificially intelligent system to defeat a top professional player in StarCraft II. We will study the fundamentals and practical applications of reinforcement learning and will cover the latest methods used to create agents that can solve a variety of complex tasks, with applications ranging from gaming to finance to robotics.
